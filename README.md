## The project includes the following files:

* train.py: the code containing necessary function calls to run the model and report the results. Includes novel implementations by project authors as well as original implementation by #Lorge et al. (2024).
* helper_functions.py: the file containing functions necessary for preprocessign the GNN and dataset for running it. It includes the novel functionalities by the project authors and the original code implementation by Lorge et al. (2024).
* dataset.py: the file containing code for preprocessing textual data from the dataset and constructing signed bipartite graphs.
* models.py: the file including the models code for Signed Convolutional Weighted Graph and STEntConv model developed by Lorge et al. (2024)
* train.csv: contains dataset part for training the model.
* dev.csv: contains dataset part for model evaluation
* dev.csv contains dataset part for model testing.
* pretrained_bert: directory containing fine-tuned BERT on the whole DEBAGREEMENT dataset
* json files which contain precomputed edges


# to run the code please put all directory content in the same directory, open BERT_Training.ipynb, run the resulting code there and run train.py

## Note
* This is a postgraduate research project 
* In case of any issues please contact Bartosz Watrobinski
